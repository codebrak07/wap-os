# 🚀 WAP OS — Exam Preparation & Structured Learning Platform

**WAP OS** is an academic preparation platform designed to help students revise smarter, practice efficiently, and prepare for exams with clarity and speed.  
Built **by a student, for fellow students**, the platform combines structured learning resources with practical coding execution in one unified environment.

---

## 📌 Overview

WAP OS is a web-based exam preparation system that provides topic-wise explanations, organized study material, and an integrated coding environment to support both theoretical understanding and practical learning.

Instead of switching between notes, IDEs, and multiple websites, students can revise and practice — all in one place.

## ❓ Problem It Solves

During exam preparation, students commonly face:

- Scattered study resources across multiple platforms  
- Time wasted setting up coding environments  
- Difficulty revising concepts quickly before exams  
- Lack of structured revision material aligned with syllabus topics  
- Constant context-switching between theory and practice  

**WAP OS solves this by creating a single, structured revision ecosystem** focused on efficiency and last-minute preparation.
